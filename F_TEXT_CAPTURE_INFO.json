Every number of turns it uses <color=255:255:0>swallow</color> to instantly KO a single unit, so be sure to prepare yourself with <color=255:255:0>raise</color> and <color=255:255:0>phoenix downs</color>.^^어빌리티나 마법 공격을 강력한 맞받아치기로 반격하는 성가신 마물. <color=255:255:0>마법 맞받아치기</color>는 2턴마다 발동하므로 타이밍에 맞춰 속성 마법을 퍼부으며, 그 외에는 일반 공격이나 LB 등으로 피해를 주자. 몇 턴마다 <color=255:255:0>삼키기</color>로 아군 1명을 즉사시키니, <color=255:255:0>레이즈</color>나 <color=255:255:0>피닉스의 깃털</color>을 사용할 수 있도록 준비해두자.^^^Un poderoso monstruo capaz de desatar potentes contraataques contra habilidades y magia. Su <color=255:255:0>Contramagia</color> se activa cada 2 turnos, así que usa tu magia cuando no esté activo, y usa ataques normales y EL en el resto de casos. Cada cierto número de turnos, también usa <color=255:255:0>Tragar</color> para dejar K.O. al instante a una unidad, así que ve preparado con <color=255:255:0>Lázaro</color> y <color=255:255:0>colas de fénix</color>.
MST_CAPTURE_INFO_899212201^This <color=255:0:0>belmodar</color> has more HP and is stronger than what appears at the Earth Shrine. Its <color=255:255:0>charge</color> and <color=255:255:0>10,000 volts</color> also does more damage. It is weak against magic, but lightning doesn't seem to work well against it, so use magic besides that when attacking.^^땅의 신전에서 등장했을 때보다 HP와 공격력이 모두 강해진 <color=255:0:0>벨모다</color>. <color=255:255:0>돌진</color>이나 <color=255:255:0>10,000볼트</color>의 피해량도 커졌다. 마법에 대한 방어력이 낮은 것이 약점이나, 번개속성 공격은 효과가 그다지 없으므로 그 외의 마법으로 집중적인 공격을 퍼붓자.^^^Este <color=255:0:0>Belmodar</color> tiene más VIT y es más fuerte de lo que parece en el Templo de la Tierra. Sus habilidades <color=255:255:0>Embestida</color> y <color=255:255:0>10.000 voltios</color> también infligen más daño. Asimismo, es débil contra la magia, pero rayo parece no hacerle demasiada mella.
MST_CAPTURE_INFO_899212301^The <color=255:0:0>ipooh</color> is able to strike repeatedly with <color=255:255:0>claw</color>. A member in your party may be instantly KO'd by it, so be sure you have means of revival. The <color=255:0:0>ipooh</color> is weak against fire, so using fire based attacks will prove useful. When facing the 2 <color=255:0:0>magitek armors</color> that also appears, use lightning attacks against them.^^날카로운 <color=255:255:0>손톱</color>으로 연속 공격을 펼치는 <color=255:0:0>이푸</color>. 파티원이 일격에 전투불능 상태에 빠질 가능성이 있으니, 회복 수단을 항상 준비해두는 것이 좋다. <color=255:0:0>이푸</color>는 불속성 공격에 약하므로 불속성 무기나 마법을 써서 공격하는 것이 효과적이다. 동시에 나타나는 2대의 <color=255:0:0>마도 아머</color>는 약점인 번개속성으로 공격하자.^^^El <color=255:0:0>ipú</color> es capaz de golpear varias veces con su habilidad <color=255:255:0>Garra</color>. De hecho, hasta algún miembro de tu equipo podría caer K.O. ante este ataque. Por ello, asegúrate de poder revivir aliados. Por su parte, el <color=255:0:0>ipú</color> es débil contra el fuego. Además, cuando te enfrentes a las dos <color=255:0:0>armaduras mágicas</color> que también aparecerán, usa ataques de rayo contra estas.
MST_CAPTURE_INFO_899212401^The <color=255:0:0>purusa</color> has high HP and can deal heavy physical damage, but is very weak against elemental attacks, so use the strongest elemental attack you have possible against it. The <color=255:255:0>gigas worm</color> also appears together with it, and has high HP. It uses a powerful attack, <color=255:255:0>crash</color>, so it is best to defeat this monster first by striking its weakness using ice attacks.^^<color=255:0:0>푸루샤</color> 자체는 물리 공격력과 HP가 높으나, 속성에 대한 저항력이 없으므로 무조건 강력한 공격으로 HP를 깎아나가자. 동시에 나타나는 <color=255:0:0>기가스 지렁이</color>역시 HP가 높으며 <color=255:255:0>몸통 박치기</color> 같은 강력한 공격도 가지고 있기 때문에, 약점인 얼음속성 공격으로 먼저 쓰러뜨려야 안전하게 싸울 수 있다.^^^El <color=255:0:0>purusa</color> tiene VIT alta y es capaz de infligir bastante daño físico; pero, a su vez, es bastante débil contra los ataques elementales. Por tanto, usa tus mejores ataques elementales siempre que puedas al luchar contra él. Por su parte, el <color=255:255:0>gusano gigas</color> también aparece junto a él y tiene la VIT alta. Este último usa su potente ataque <color=255:255:0>Placaje</color>, por lo que se recomienda derrotar a este monstruo primero usando ataques de hielo para aprovechar su punto débil.
MST_CAPTURE_INFO_899212501^The <color=255:0:0>skadi</color> appears in battle with 2 <color=255:0:0>damias</color>. The <color=255:0:0>damias</color> uses <color=255:255:0>stone</color>, and the <color=255:0:0>skadi</color> uses <color=255:255:0>blizzard</color>. The <color=255:0:0>damias</color> are weak against wind attacks, and the <color=255:0:0>skadi</color> is weak against fire attacks, but if your party has units skilled using physical attacks, it may prove faster by simply having them focus their attacks on each monster one at a time.^^2마리 <color=255:0:0>스카디</color>를 데리고 나타나는 <color=255:0:0>다미아</color>. <color=255:0:0>다미아</color>는 <color=255:255:0>스톤</color>, <color=255:0:0>스카디</color>는 <color=255:255:0>블리자드</color> 마법을 다룬다. <color=255:0:0>다미아</color>의 약점인 바람속성, <color=255:0:0>스카디</color>의 약점인 불속성 공격이 유효하나, 파티에 물리공격이 특기인 유닛이 몇 명 있다면 물리공격으로 하나씩 격파하는 전술도 효과적이다.^^^El <color=255:0:0>skadi</color> aparece en combate junto a dos <color=255:0:0>damias</color>. Por su parte, los <color=255:0:0>damias</color> usan <color=255:255:0>Piedra</color> y los <color=255:0:0>skadi</color> usan <color=255:255:0>Hielo</color>. Asimismo, los <color=255:0:0>damias</color> son vulnerables a los ataques de viento, mientras que el <color=255:0:0>skadi</color> es débil contra los de fuego. Sin embargo, si cuentas con unidades en tu equipo que inflijan un daño físico considerable, podrías acabar más rápido si simplemente centras tus ataques en un monstruo específico y los vas eliminando uno a uno.
MST_CAPTURE_INFO_899212601^The <color=255:0:0>wandering one</color> is able to cast fire magic that can hit all its enemies at once. It can also use the ability, <color=255:255:0>flash</color>, that can blind party units, so it would be best to prepare yourselves with a stock of <color=255:255:0>eye drops</color> or with <color=255:255:0>blinda</color>. <color=255:0:0>Damias</color> also appears together in battle, so be wary of its resistance to earth attacks.^^불속성 전체 마법을 다룰 수 있는 <color=255:0:0>방황하는 자</color>. 게다가 <color=255:255:0>플래시</color> 어빌리티로 파티를 암흑 상태에 빠뜨리기 때문에, <color=255:255:0>안약</color>이나 <color=255:255:0>블라나</color>를 준비해두자. 동시에 나타나는 <color=255:0:0>다미아</color>는 땅속성에 저항력이 있으니 주의해야 한다.^^^El <color=255:0:0>ser errante</color> es capaz de lanzar magia de fuego contra todos sus enemigos a la vez. También, puede usar su habilidad <color=255:255:0>Flash</color> para cegar a las unidades que conforman tu equipo, por lo que no te vendría mal ir provisto de <color=255:255:0>colirios</color> o con <color=255:255:0>Luz</color>. Por su parte, junto a este enemigo, también pueden aparecer <color=255:0:0>damias</color>, por lo que ten en cuenta que son resistentes a los ataques de tierra.
MST_CAPTURE_INFO_899212701^The <color=255:0:0>red elemental</color> appears in battle along with 2 <color=255:0:0>abhorrent ones</color>. The <color=255:0:0>red elemental</color> is weak against ice attacks, while the <color=255:0:0>abhorrent ones</color> are weak against fire attacks. When an <color=255:0:0>abhorrent one's</color> HP is low, it will begin casting <color=255:255:0>protect</color> and <color=255:255:0>shell</color> on itself, so either use abilities that can remove those effects, or simply focus your fire attacks on it.^^<color=255:0:0>붉은 원소</color> 2마리를 데리고 등장하는 <color=255:0:0>불길한 자</color>. <color=255:0:0>붉은 원소</color>의 약점이 얼음속성인 것과 반대로, <color=255:0:0>불길한 자</color>의 약점은 불속성이니 주의하자. 불길한 자는 HP가 낮아지면 <color=255:255:0>프로테스</color>, <color=255:255:0>셸</color>을 자신에게 걸기 시작하므로, 상태 변화를 지우는 어빌리티를 사용하거나 강력한 불속성 공격으로 계속 밀어붙이자.^^^El <color=255:0:0>ente rojo</color> aparece en combate junto con dos <color=255:0:0>seres horrendos</color>. Por su parte, el <color=255:0:0>ente rojo</color> es vulnerable contra los ataques de hielo, mientras que los <color=255:0:0>seres horrendos</color> son débiles contra los de fuego. Cuando un <color=255:0:0>ser horrendo</color> tiene la VIT baja, este empezará a usar <color=255:255:0>Coraza</color> y <color=255:255:0>Escudo</color> sobre sí mismo. Por tanto, tendrás que usar habilidades que anulen esos efectos o, simplemente, lanzarle ataques de fuego.
MST_CAPTURE_INFO_899212801^The <color=255:0:0>xiphactinus</color> uses <color=255:255:0>horn</color> and <color=255:255:0>bound</color> as its physical attacks. Despite being rather small in size, it packs quite a punch with its high HP and attack power, so be careful as it could bring massive damage to your party. Just like other water-based creatures, it is weak against lightning attacks, but be careful of the <color=255:0:0>skeleton</color> that appears with it as it is weak against fire and not lightning.^^<color=255:255:0>뿔</color>이나 <color=255:255:0>뛰어오르기</color> 같은 물리공격 어빌리티를 가진 <color=255:0:0>크시팍티누스</color>. 소형 마물 치고는 HP과 공격력이 높아 방심했다가는 예상치 못한 큰 피해를 받을 수도 있다. 수중형 마물답게 번개속성 공격에는 약하나, 동시에 나타나는 <color=255:0:0>해골</color>의 약점이 불속성이라는 것도 기억해두자.^^^El <color=255:0:0>xiphactinus</color> usa <color=255:255:0>Cuerno</color> y <color=255:255:0>Atado</color> como ataques físicos. A pesar de su tamaño reducido, es bastante fuerte debido a su VIT alta y su potencia de ataque, así que ten cuidado porque podría causarle estragos a tu equipo. Asimismo, al igual que otras criaturas de agua, es vulnerable a los ataques de rayo. Aun así, ten cuidado con el <color=255:0:0>esqueleto</color> que aparece junto a él, pues este es vulnerable al fuego y no al rayo.
MST_CAPTURE_INFO_899212901^A combination of the giant reaper, <color=255:0:0>fossil dragon</color>, and the giant avian, <color=255:0:0>vulture</color>. Both have high HP and use special magic making them quite the adversary to face. The <color=255:0:0>fossil dragon</color> is weak against a number of elements - fire, ice, water, and light, so it is suggested to first focus all attacks on it, then focus your attacks on the <color=255:0:0>vulture</color> using wind attacks.^^사령형 대형 마물인 <color=255:0:0>용의 화석</color>과 조류형 대형 마물인 <color=255:0:0>시체수리</color>. 둘 다 HP와 공격력이 높은 데다 특수한 마법을 다루는 성가신 마물이다. 먼저 불, 얼음, 물, 빛이 모두 약점인 <color=255:0:0>용의 화석</color>을 집중적으로 공격해 쓰러뜨린 후, 남은 <color=255:0:0>시체수리</color>에 약점인 바람속성 공격을 퍼붓자.^^^Un grupo formado por el <color=255:0:0>dracofósil</color>, el gran segador, y el <color=255:0:0>buitre</color>, la gran ave. Ambos cuentan con una VIT alta y usan magia especial para destruir a sus enemigos. El <color=255:0:0>dracofósil</color> es débil contra varios elementos como el fuego, el hielo, el agua y la luz. Por tanto, lo primero que se aconseja es que centres todos tus ataques en él y, luego, vayas a por el <color=255:0:0>buitre</color> usando ataques de viento.
MST_CAPTURE_INFO_899213001^The <color=255:0:0>killer shark</color> uses a very powerful physical attack ability, <color=255:255:0>charge</color>. It isn't particularly weak against any element, so use the strongest physical attack and magic you have available. The <color=255:0:0>cursed bones</color> also appears in battle, and has high HP, so it is best to take care of it first using fire attacks and light attacks.^^강렬한 물리공격인 <color=255:255:0>돌진</color> 어빌리티를 가진 <color=255:0:0>살인상어</color>. 특히 약점으로 보이는 속성이 없으니, 무조건 강력한 물리공격과 공격마법을 쏟아 붓자. 동시에 나타나는 <color=255:0:0>저주받은 해골</color>도 공격력과 HP가 높으므로 약점인 불속성이나 빛속성 공격으로 먼저 쓰러뜨리는 것을 추천한다.^^^El <color=255:0:0>tiburón asesino</color> cuenta con un ataque físico muy potente: <color=255:255:0>Carga</color>. Por otra parte, no es especialmente débil contra ningún elemento, así que puedes usar contra él tus mejores ataques tanto físicos como mágicos. En combate, va acompañado de un <color=255:0:0>esqueleto maldito</color> de VIT alta. Por tanto, lo mejor es que te deshagas de él usando ataques de fuego y luz.

El <color=255:0:0>teniente coronel Charlot</color> va acompañado de dos <color=255:0:0>soldados imperiales</color>, por lo que lo mejor es deshacerse primero de estos, ya que cuentan con una VIT menor.
MST_CAPTURE_INFO_710010501^The <color=255:255:0>brionac</color> will unleash a powerful physical attack that will hit all members in the party when it is struck with magic, so it is best not to attack it with any damage inducing magic. When its HP is at half, it will strike all members in the party with magic that can inflict paralysis, so prepare your units by healing them or boosting their stats in preparation before reducing its HP to half.^^<color=255:0:0>브뤼낙</color>은 마법 공격을 받으면 강력한 전체 물리공격을 사용하므로, 공격 계열 마법은 봉인하자.

The <color=255:0:0>ochu</color> uses the powerful physical attack, <color=255:255:0>ochu dance</color>, which deals multiple damage against all members in your party, so it is highly advised to always keep your HP as full as possible.^^<color=255:0:0>사보텐더</color>를 거느린 <color=255:0:0>오츄</color>가 출현. 일단 <color=255:0:0>사보텐더</color>의 <color=255:255:0>바늘 1,000개</color> 공격을 봉쇄하기 위해 얼음, 물속성의 공격을 구사하여 먼저 <color=255:0:0>사보텐더</color>를 쓰러뜨리자. <color=255:0:0>오츄</color>의 강력한 물리공격인 <color=255:255:0>오츄의 춤</color>은 파티 전체에 여러 번 피해를 주므로, HP를 항상 가득 채워두는 정도의 신중함이 필요하다.^^^Durante los combates, el <color=255:0:0>ochú</color> aparece con un <color=255:0:0>cactilio</color>.

The longer the battle, the more you will be at a disadvantage, so use whatever elemental attack and abilities you have to end the battle as quickly as possible.^^<color=255:0:0>지옥의 기수</color>는 강력한 물리공격 어빌리티인 <color=255:255:0>실버 랜스</color>을 1턴에 최고 3회 사용한다. 파티원이 일격에 전투불능 상태에 빠지지 않도록 물리 방어 마법으로 대항하자. 전투가 길어질수록 불리하므로 약점인 불과 어둠속성을 가진 무기나 어빌리티로 단숨에 HP를 깎는 전술이 효과적이다.^^^El <color=255:0:0>jinete infernal</color> usa <color=255:255:0>Lanza plateada</color>, un potente ataque físico que es capaz de golpear 3 veces en un solo turno. Para evitar acabar K.O., protege a tu equipo con magia que aumente la DEF.

To add, the <color=255:0:0>headstone</color> uses <color=255:255:0>flash</color>, which can induce blind, so using magic can help avoid the effects of blind.^^높은 물리 방어력을 자랑하는 <color=255:0:0>블록</color>과 함께 <color=255:0:0>왕두꺼비</color>와 <color=255:0:0>담쟁이덩굴</color>이 나타난다. <color=255:0:0>왕두꺼비</color>는 얼음, <color=255:0:0>담쟁이덩굴</color>은 불속성 공격에 약하므로 마법 방어력이 낮은 <color=255:0:0>블록</color>을 포함하여 공격 마법을 중심으로 한 전술이 효과적이다. <color=255:0:0>블록</color>이 사용하는 <color=255:255:0>플래시</color>에 의해 암흑 상태가 되더라도 마법은 맞힐 수 있다.^^^La <color=255:0:0>lápida</color>, que resiste bastante bien los ataques físicos, aparece en los combates junto a la <color=255:0:0>rana gigante</color> y a la <color=255:0:0>hiedra</color>.

Por tanto, usar magia para atacar a todos estos monstruos a la vez es una estrategia efectiva. Además, la <color=255:0:0>lápida</color> usa <color=255:255:0>Flash</color>, que inflige ceguera, por lo que podrías usar magia para evitar los efectos de la ceguera.

The power the <color=255:0:0>sergeant</color> holds is a nuisance, but it is of greater importance to take care of the <color=255:0:0>coeurl</color> that can prevent your units from action. Using ice attacks against the <color=255:0:0>allosaur</color> is effective.^^마비를 일으키는 <color=255:255:0>블래스터</color> 어빌리티를 가진 <color=255:0:0>커얼</color>과, 큰 피해를 줄 수 있는 <color=255:255:0>물어뜯기</color> 공격을 가진 <color=255:0:0>알로사우루스</color>를 이끄는 <color=255:0:0>십인대장</color>. <color=255:0:0>십인대장</color>의 힘도 성가시지만, 아군의 행동을 봉쇄하는 <color=255:0:0>커얼</color>을 먼저 쓰러뜨려야 한다. <color=255:0:0>알로사우루스</color>에는 얼음속성 공격이 효과적이다.^^^El <color=255:0:0>sargento</color> aparece junto a un <color=255:0:0>bengal</color> que usa <color=255:255:0>Electroplasma</color>, una habilidad que inflige parálisis, y un <color=255:0:0>alosaurio</color> que usa <color=255:255:0>Mordisco</color> para infligir un daño físico elevado. Asimismo, el <color=255:0:0>sargento</color> es un incordio; pero es más importante que te encargues del <color=255:0:0>bengal</color>, pues este puede hacer que tus unidades pierdan su oportunidad de maniobrar.

El daño que inflige en un solo turno es bastante elevado, por lo que ve preparado para curarte.

Asimismo, aprovéchate de su punto débil y atácale con magia de agua y habilidades que causen la mayor cantidad de daño posible.

MST_CAPTURE_INFO_729070701^The <color=255:255:0>roar</color> used by the <color=255:0:0>satanachia</color> can inflict damage and confusion on all members in your party, so focus your attacks on the <color=255:0:0>satanachia</color> to get rid of it as soon as possible.

MST_CAPTURE_INFO_729080701^It doesn't use any special attacks, but it can strike multiple times, so if any of your units are low on HP, focus on defense until you have better control of the battlefield. Each of its parts have different weaknesses, so when striking them, try to use non-elemental attacks.^^^^^
MST_CAPTURE_INFO_729090501^It uses <color=255:255:0>unseen strike</color> to inflict heavy damage, so use <color=255:255:0>cover ally</color> or guard any units low on HP, and use your strongest attack available to take the enemy down.^^^^^
MST_CAPTURE_INFO_729090801^When its HP is low, it will use <color=255:255:0>swallow</color> to deal instant KO against a single target, so be careful. If that happens, use <color=255:255:0>raise</color> or a <color=255:255:0>phoenix down</color> to revive any fallen units as soon as possible.^^^^^

MST_CAPTURE_INFO_401010101^The <color=255:0:0>donchu</color> absorbs light before unleashing its powerful attack that can strike all members in your party. If you notice it is gathering light in battle, use attacks, such as <color=255:255:0>undermine</color>, or magic that can lower its stats to protect your units from its attack to come in the following turn. If you attack its weakness with fire, it will unleash a powerful counterattack, so after using a fire attack, follow it with a water attack within the same turn to prevent it from counterattacking.^^^^^
MST_CAPTURE_INFO_401020101^It is resistant to a wide number of elementals, so use abilities, such as <color=255:255:0>blade flash - awakened</color>, to lower its resistance before attacking. It unleashes a powerful attack that targets a single unit, so be sure to guard when needed, and heal often to prevent casualties. If it uses <color=255:255:0>concentrate</color> during battle, use abilities, such as <color=255:255:0>fingersnap</color>, to dispel the enemy's boost effect.^^^^^

MST_CAPTURE_INFO_730010401^All of its attacks are powerful, and it can act multiple times in a turn, so prepare your party well by using abilities that can boost your party's DEF and SPR, and prepare means to reduce the incoming damage during battle. The <color=255:0:0>shadow lord</color> can change its stats during battle, so be conscious of its state to determine whether to strike with physical attacks or with magic. Note that the <color=255:0:0>shadow lord</color> will not retreat in this battle.^^^^^
MST_CAPTURE_INFO_171010401^It has a lot of HP, so prepare for the long battle with means to recover MP. It also has high defense, and uses abilities that can inflict stone and instantly KO units. It will be a harsh battle if your party doesn't have the resistance or the means against the ailment and the instant KO attack, so be sure you prepare your party with the gear and abilities needed to counter them.^^^^^
MST_CAPTURE_INFO_171020401^Beware of the incoming damage as it will now use abilities that can strike multiple times. It also will use a powerful ability that will strike all members in your party hard enough to take down your units, so be sure to boost your party's stats, and to use debuffs when facing it.^^^^^

MST_CAPTURE_INFO_171050501^Though it doesn't have very many abilities that can strike your party at once, it does use boosts to increase its stats every set number of turns, which in turn increases the damage it can deal to its target. One wrong move and it can bring down your party surprisingly quickly, so be very careful. Fortunately, most of the abilities it uses are fire based attacks, so increasing your fire resistance should help alleviate the incoming damage. Using <color=255:255:0>fira</color> should make the battle much easier.^^^^^
MST_CAPTURE_INFO_171060501^It uses a variety of abilities, and will become extremely aggressive when its HP hits a certain point. It uses <color=255:255:0>elemental power</color>, which makes it difficult to deal damage using elemental attacks, so try and use non-elemental attacks as possible. Increasing your water resistance and SPR will lower the incoming damage a bit. Beware of its random instant KO attack, too.^^^^^
MST_CAPTURE_INFO_171070501^A simple opponent that only uses normal attacks and <color=255:255:0>fireball</color>. It doesn't have any dangerous moves, but it is still quite powerful, and can take multiple actions, so be careful. It may focus its attacks on your healer, so use abilities, such as <color=255:255:0>draw attacks</color>, to shift its target away, or simply increase your party's defense.^^^^^
MST_CAPTURE_INFO_171080501^A very powerful opponent that uses a dangerous ability, and can deal out heavy damage. If an ally uses an ability that boosts stats, it will unleash an extremely powerful attack, <color=255:255:0>seal of conviction</color>, that can strike all members in your party at once. Because this move has <color=255:255:0>dispel</color> properties, it will wipe out any buffs on your units at once. Fortunately, it is susceptible to debuffs, so it is recommended that you try to lower its stats to gain an advantage in battle.^^^^^
MST_CAPTURE_INFO_171080601^A dangerous monster that uses a powerful earth attack ability that can strike all members in your party.

MST_CAPTURE_INFO_731010101^Most of the abilities it uses can strike your party members at once, so it is essential that you are wary of your party's HP. It doesn't use any ailments, so focus your actions on trying to keep the damage minimal.^^^^^
MST_CAPTURE_INFO_731010201^The biggest difference from the <color=255:0:0>ghidra</color> is that it doesn't have any physical attacks or abilities that can strike your party at once. Instead, it uses <color=255:255:0>dark whisper</color>, which has a chance of either inflicting sleep, or dealing instant KO to your unit. It only can target 1 unit, and the success rate isn't that great, so it's not as bad as it sounds, but there is a chance it will succeed, and may even land on your healer, so be sure you have alternate means if such happens.^^^^^
MST_CAPTURE_INFO_731010301^A dangerous opponent that uses powerful magic to strike all members in your party, and an ability that has the same effect as <color=255:255:0>stop</color>.

At the very least, bring a unit that can boost your party's SPR.^^^^^
MST_CAPTURE_INFO_731010401^Be very careful of <color=255:255:0>ultima</color>, which it will use at the very beginning of battle and when its HP dips to a certain point. It also uses an array of powerful single target magic. It will use at every set number of turns <color=255:255:0>hurricane</color>, so be sure you heal your units immediately after.^^^^^
MST_CAPTURE_INFO_731010501^<color=255:255:0>High Seraph Ultima</color> doesn't use many abilities, thus making it a bit easier to face, but if you use debuffs against it, it will begin using powerful abilities, so be very careful when trying to weaken it. Note that defeating <color=255:255:0>High Seraph Ultima</color> first will trigger the <color=255:255:0>ultima demons</color> to begin using <color=255:255:0>ultima</color>, so if possible, try and defeat the <color=255:255:0>ultima demons</color> first.^^^^^
MST_CAPTURE_INFO_732010101^A formidable enemy that uses powerful magic that can strike all members in your party, and attacks that can inflict ailments. Be very well prepared before facing this enemy by equipping gear and stocking items which can counter ailments. It uses <color=255:255:0>mute</color> every number of turns, which absorbs all the MP from a single target, so bring as many items that can recover MP as possible. It will also summon reinforcements if the battle takes too long, so be careful.^^^^^
MST_CAPTURE_INFO_733010601^If it is struck with a physical attack, it will unleash a powerful attack that will strike all members in your party, so use magic to deal damage instead.^^^^^

MST_CAPTURE_INFO_733040601^An enemy that has high HP, and uses <color=255:255:0>drain</color> in battle. If it is hit with a magic attack, it will use <color=255:255:0>osmose</color> to absorb MP. If you want to avoid getting your MP absorbed, avoid using magic attacks.^^^^^
MST_CAPTURE_INFO_733050601^The <color=255:0:0>wandering one</color> uses fire magic, and the <color=255:0:0>abhorrent one</color> uses ice magic. When their HP dips to a certain point, they will use <color=255:255:0>protect</color> and <color=255:255:0>shell</color>, so use <color=255:255:0>dispel</color> to remove their buffs.^^^^^
MST_CAPTURE_INFO_733060601^It uses <color=255:255:0>bone</color> to deal heavy damage, and <color=255:255:0>tail</color>, which can inflict paralysis. Use fire and light attacks to defeat it as quickly as possible.^^^^^
MST_CAPTURE_INFO_733070601^The powerful <color=255:0:0>bulbous</color> uses <color=255:255:0>silver lance</color>, which can cause massive damage. Either inflict blind on it, so that it misses when attacking, or use light attacks to defeat it as quickly as possible.^^^^^
MST_CAPTURE_INFO_733080701^A powerful enemy that boosts its attack power when its HP dips to a certain point. It usually attacks with fire, so using <color=255:255:0>barfire</color> to boost your fire resistance can make the battle easier.^^^^^
MST_CAPTURE_INFO_733090601^The <color=255:0:0>high officer</color> and <color=255:0:0>soldiers</color> can inflict confusion, so it is absolutely necessary that you prepare means to counter confusion. Though the healing used by the <color=255:0:0>Grandshelt soldiers</color> isn't very strong, it can be a nuisance, so defeat them as soon as possible.^^^^^
MST_CAPTURE_INFO_733100501^The <color=255:0:0>Azure Knight</color> uses ice attacks and magic, such as <color=255:255:0>blizzaga</color> and <color=255:255:0>aeroga</color>. The <color=255:0:0>Crimson Knight</color> uses fire attacks and magic, such as <color=255:255:0>firaga</color> and <color=255:255:0>stonga</color>. Defeating either one will make the other stronger, so it is best to leave the one you have a better chance against for last.^^^^^

Also note that the action taken by the <color=255:0:0>Aigaion</color> and its <color=255:0:0>left arm</color> will change depending on the element used to attack it with, so see if you can use that to your advantage.^^^^^

MST_CAPTURE_INFO_785020701^The enemy is weak against light attacks, so equipping units with light element weapons, or using abilities that deals light damage should make quick work of the enemy.^^^^^
